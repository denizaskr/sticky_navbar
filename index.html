            I am a 4th year computer science student at Mersin University. 
            I will graduate in February,2023. My interest in computers started in high school. 
            I wondered basic working logic of the computer, how the programs we use are made and how the games we spent a lot of time on were made.
            Throughout my education, I tried to follow and learn about up-to-date technologies. 
            By bringing my English to a professional level, I benefited from many different sources in the field of software. 
            I have a character who likes to solve problems. Thanks to the tasks I took in the communities I was in at the University, I increased my social skills.
            I am developing Front-end and I am interested in Blockchain. I am actively looking for an internship.
